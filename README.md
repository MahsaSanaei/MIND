# MIND

This project is about MIND dataset. MIcrosoft News Dataset (MIND) is a large-scale dataset for news recommendation research. It was collected from anonymized behavior logs of Microsoft News website. 

# Steps of Project:

Step 1: 

* R&D on MIND dataset


Step 2:

* Some general search about the task


Step 3: 

* 01-download.ipynb: download the dataset using python


step 4: 

* Having a look at the data


step 5: 

* Preprocessing


Step 6:
 
* Implement baseline classification model with Tfidf and Evaluation 

* 02-baseline-classification.ipynb
